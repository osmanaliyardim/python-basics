Stock Maximum Profit (A Google's Interview Question)
"""

"""
Question: You will be given a list of stock prices for a given day and your goal is to return the maximum profit
that could have been made by buying a stock at the given price and then selling the stock later on.
For example, if the input is: [45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11] then your program should return 16 
because if you bought the stock at dolar 24 and sold it at dolar 40, a profit of dolar 16 was made
and this is the largest profit that could be made. If no profit could have been made, return -1.
